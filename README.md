# Wordpress Terminal

This is a theme I developed for my website, note that the theme itself is not intented to be highly customizable since I have no plans on selling it or using it for other than my personal site, to edit the strings / texts, change the files at `/src/views`

Demo available here: https://jose.com.co

## How to

To run this locally (note that posts and stuff related to wordpress might not work):

```js
npm install
npm start
```

To compile any changes made, do

```js
npm run build
```

## Install as a theme

Zip the contents of this repo and use the wordpress theme installer

# Feel free to use/share/remix it but please always reference my work.
